# test_runner
Project from Stephen Grider Modern JS Bootcamp

A Node.js based testing framework.

The program will find any files in your folder labeled with "*.test.js" and run the tests.

Tests can take place in the browser or in the CLI. 

When in the command line enter into any folder and type the command 'tme'. If there are testing files they will run and display results.
